# Conclusions


After analyzing and visualizing the data and the questions I wanted to get answers to, I found out few absorbing things I want to share :

1. The Death Percentage is not as scary as I thought. It is only 2 percent!
2. My country (Israel) is the top country from those I have chosen to focus on, in infection percentages. It means that our government doesn't handle the virus well.
3. The time that took to the vaccinations to block the infections was about 1.5 months from the time people started vaccinate
