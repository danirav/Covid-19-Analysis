Analyzing Covid 19 Dataset Using MYSQL  and Tableau For Visualizations

The data i used for the analysis was taken from the Covid-19 dataset - https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths

First , I separated the data to various tables to make the access less complicated in MySqL,
Then I handled tha Null values so they won't make any problems while importing the data from the CSV files to MySQL
The next part was to think about intersting topics and queries ,
so i can visualize it later in tableau and make people gain deep insights about the Covid 19,
And the final part was to extract the results of my queries in CSV files, and use it to visualize the analysis in Tableau

If you have any suggestions that can improve my analysis the next time i would be very happy to know that
