# Covid-19-Analysis
Analyzing Covid 19 Dataset Using MYSQL  and Tableau For Visualizations

The data I used for the analysis was taken from the Covid-19 dataset - https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths

First, I separated the data into various tables to make the access less complicated in MySQL,

Then I handled the Null values so they won't make any problems while importing the data from the CSV files to MySQL

The next part was to think about interesting topics and queries,
so I can visualize it later in tableau and make people gain deep insights about the Covid 19,

And the final part was to extract the results of my queries in CSV files and use them to visualize the analysis in Tableau

Here you can see the dashboard I made - https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/daniel3357/viz/Covid19Analysis_16316095255210/Dashboard1?publish=yes





# Conclusions


After analyzing and visualizing the data and the questions I wanted to get answers to, I found out few absorbing things I want to share :

1. The Death Percentage is not as scary as I thought. It is only 2 percent!
2. My country (Israel) is the top country from those I have chosen to focus on, in infection percentages. It means that our government doesn't handle the virus well.
3. The time that took to the vaccinations to block the infections was about 1.5 months from the time people started getting vaccinated

If you have any suggestions that can improve my analysis the next time I would be happy to know that
